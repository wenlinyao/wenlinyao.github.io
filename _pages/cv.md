More about Me
======
I practised Chinese traditional calligraphy for many years when I was in primary school. 
When I studied in <a href="http://www.zzyz.com.cn/">No.1 Middle School of Zhengzhou</a>, I also actively participated in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematics_competitions">National Mathematical Olympiad in Senior</a>. Euclidean plane geometry is my favorite discipline and in my opinion, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-point_circle">Nine-point circle theorem</a> is the most elegant Math theorem.
