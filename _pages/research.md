I am broadly interested in the general area of Artificial Intelligence, with emphasis on Natural Language Processing, Information Extraction, Machine Learning. I derive great delight from solving challenging problems in these areas! Now, I'm working on Weakly Supervised Learning, event relations extraction, and event common-sense knowledge acquisition.<br><br>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon"><i>Herbert A. Simon</i></a> said that human intelligence is just the rule-governed manipulation of symbols. I believe one day machines could achieve the same capacity of human's intelligence. I dream to commit myself to this challenge and to make human life better. But <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html"><i>“of course, AI itself is just part of a grander scheme driving the universe from simple initial conditions to more and more unfathomable complexity. Finally, even this awesome process may be just a tiny part of the even grander, optimally efficient computation of all logically possible universes.”</i></a> <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/"><i>--Jürgen Schmidhuber</i></a> <br>
