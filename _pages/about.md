Hello! I am a senior researcher at Tencent AI Lab (Seattle). Before joining Tencent, I earned my Ph.D. from the <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University (TAMU), College Station</a> under the supervision of <a href = "http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/huangrh/">Prof. Ruihong Huang</a>. I got my Bachelor's degree from <a href="http://www.dlut.edu.cn/">Dalian University of Technology (DUT)</a> in 2015.
