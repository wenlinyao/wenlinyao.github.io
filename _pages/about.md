Hello! I am a Principle Researcher at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/">Microsoft Research, Redmond</a>. Prior to this, I was a Senior Applied Scientist at Amazon Stores Foundational AI, working on <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus">GenAI for shopping</a>. Before that, I was a Senior Researcher at <a href="https://ailab.tencent.com/ailab/en/about/">Tencent AI Lab, Bellevue</a>. I earned my Ph.D. from the <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University (TAMU)</a> in 2020. Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree (with Outstanding Graduate Award) from <a href="http://www.dlut.edu.cn/">Dalian University of Technology (DUT)</a> in 2015.


My research interests center on improving foundation LLMs through end-to-end Reinforcement Learning and agentic frameworks, with a focus on complex problem-solving, tool usage, and interaction with environments.
